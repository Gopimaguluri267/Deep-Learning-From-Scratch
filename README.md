# Deep-Learning-From-Scratch

Implementation of deep learning algorithms and architectures from scratch using Python.

(This repository reflects my understanding of core concepts — feedback and discussions are welcome!)


### [Neural Networks](neural_networks/)
- Basic neural network components including linear layers and activation functions implemented using NumPy

### [Word2Vec](word2vec/)
- Custom implementation of Word2Vec with both CBOW and Skip-gram architectures using PyTorch
